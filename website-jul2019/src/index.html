      <h2> Artificial Intelligence Pump Classification System </h2>
      <h3> Bosch Thailand </h3>
      <hr>
      <p> In conjunction with a team of engineers and programmers, a prototype AI program was developed in the span of 3 weeks to classify the quality of pumps based on wear. This program was showcased to a management team in Vietnam. <br> <br>Without delving into too much detail, my role was to pool images of pumps and create the master library that the program would train on.</p>

   <h2> Nowledge </h2>
     <h3> Cansbridge Fellowship - Palo Alto </h3>
     <hr>
     <p> Nowledge was the result of a hackathon-style project with three other Cansbridge fellows, completed over the course of 4 days and presented at the Cansbridge Fellowship Conference. It uses the idea of AI and the ongoing problem of personalized education, and attempts to provide a service for both students and teachers to use. <br><br> </p>

      <h2> Pneumatic Drop Test Table </h2>
      <h3> Verathon Medical Canada (ULC)</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>The objective of this project was to create a table that would simulate freefall and impact of the GlideScope Core Video Monitor, as if the user dropped the monitor from holding height. </p>

      <h2> Caternary Forces Simulation </h2> 
      <h3> UBC Mars Colony Design Team </h3> 
      <hr>
      <p> One of the obstacles we faced with the construction of our life-sized expandable airlock was designing and constructing it to withstand a Martian environment on Earth. In particular, the frame and mylar covering must be flexible to withstand repeated pressurization and depressurization, rigid against severe Martian climates, but strong enough to support the weight of four astronauts and their equipment.</p> <br><br><p> My project involved simulating the forces on the rope bindings of the airlock, knowing that gravity and atmospheric pressure are significant factors on Mars.  </p>
